'''
Create class clock
within the clock class define the variables hour, minute and seconds
__str__ make it output the class like a digital class would look 00:00:00
tick() method: When called will increment the seconds and then affecting the minutes and hours. Easiest way would be a while True loop and just keeping adding one
    to the seconds. For the minutes and hours to change create an if statement? might not be that simple. 
Use the sleep function to make it print every second
