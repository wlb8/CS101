'''
Algorithm
create the wanted functions
For current value just use the given formula to find the current value
__str__ is going to take some formating but it should be easy
Money_earned needs to return the amount of money the user made. To do this just take the current value and subtract the price they bought it for to get the profit

Make a while True loop in the main for all of the things
Ask for the model year, price, current year and location
Make a new variable where it is the age of the house; current year - model year
