## PROBLEM : Create a slot machine. Where their user decides their starting bank and how much they want to bet
## 
##
## ALGORITHM : 
##      1. create all the given functions in the instructions
##      2. make a loop of a variable play so that while it is true the loop will continue 
##      3. Assign all the initial values to their own variables
##      4. Loop that will end once their bank is equal to zero
##      5. print the results of the spins and check if there are any matches by making if statement to see if they're equal
##      6. Tell the user how much they won or loss while adding that amount to the total bank (if they lost the value will be negative)
##      7. create a variable of the heighest payout they get. will be used later
##      8. ask if they want to play again
##      9. if the asnwer is no print out the heighest pay and how long it took them to lose all of their money
## ERROR HANDLING:
##      Any Special Error handling to be noted.  Wager not less than 0. play_again() kept looping until fixed
##
## OTHER COMMENTS:
